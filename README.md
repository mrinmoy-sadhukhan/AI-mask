# Hybrid Facemask Detection: Integrating Deep Learning and Handcrafted Features for Enhanced Accuracy
This is the official implementation of our paper.
## Introduction
Mask is essential things in our daily life in the psread of different aibrone diseases. But some people do not maitain this principle for this to stop them this project is build. It can accurately detect the people if they wear mask or not or in with incorrect mask type. Here we use google colaborty to compile the project. "Ai-Mask-Detect.ipynb" is used to show all model and training details in an ineractive manner.
